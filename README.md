- 👋 Hi, I’m @AgostinoNapodano I am 19.
My dream is to be able to work while moving around the globe.
I am on my way to becoming a Web Developer. I am very passionate about IT and Languages.
I can speak English fluently and for a few months, I have also been studying another language… Chinese! 🇨🇳

- 💞️ One aspect of software development that I find enjoyable is the chance to collaborate with individuals across diverse fields.
The software development process necessitates working with numerous individuals and departments,
and as someone who values interpersonal connections and enjoys cultivating new professional relationships,
it is satisfying to work alongside others who share the same objectives.

- 🌱 I’m familiar with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Php, SQL, and React,
but I’m always adding new skills to my repertoire.
I’m also eager to meet other software engineers in the area, so feel free to connect!

- 👀 I can't wait to deepen my skills!😁
